# EZ Pass FL


## Description


EZ Pass FL is a simple, user-friendly web application prototype designed to help Florida drivers track toll expenses, manage receipts, and keep a tidy history of trips made using EZ Pass lanes. The project demonstrates a small React-based front-end that showcases essential features such as adding trip expenses, viewing a live list of recorded tolls, and exporting or examining receipts for accounting and reimbursement. EZ Pass FL focuses on accessibility and clarity — with straightforward UI components (Header, Expense Form, Expense List, and Receipt preview) and a minimal state management approach suitable for small demos or as the starting point for a larger application. This repository includes clear documentation and contribution guidelines so developers can quickly clone the project, run it locally, and extend it with backend integration, authentication, or reporting in the future.
